# DreamStream Search
#### PDX CodeGuild Capstone Project by Gage Lieble
> Search for your favorite movies and find the best price.
## Project Outline
DreamStream is a Streaming Availablity search app. By using the [OTT details API](https://rapidapi.com/gox-ai-gox-ai-default/api/ott-details/details) I'm able to create a functional app that allows the user to input the title of any movie. The search result returns a page containing links to different streaming services and their different price points. Along side these results the sections similar movies, 4K status, trailer, and the movies stats will also populate on the page. utilizing the account system you can create an account within the app allows you to receive updates on price changes for specific movies via Phone number or Email.

## Project Outline
** = Special Features (Extras)
a Streaming Availablity search app. By using the [OTT details](https://rapidapi.com/gox-ai-gox-ai-default/api/ott-details/details) API I'm able to create a functional app that allows the user to input the title of any movie. The search results of the user's movie choice returns a page containing links to different streaming services at different price points. Along with the stream service links and prices the sections such as, similar movies, 4K status, trailer, and the movies stats will also populate on the result page. **By creating an account within the app allows you to receive updates on price changes for specific movies.**

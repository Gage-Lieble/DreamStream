# DreamStream Search
#### PDX CodeGuild Capstone Project
> Search for your favorite movies and find the best Price.
## Project Outline
a Streaming Availablity search app. By using the [OTT details](https://rapidapi.com/gox-ai-gox-ai-default/api/ott-details/details) API I'm able to create a functional app that allows the user to input the title of any movie. The search results of the user's movie choice returns a page containing links to different streaming services at different price points. Along with the stream service links and prices the sections such as, **similar movies, 4K status, trailer**, and the movies stats will also populate on the result page. **By creating an account within the app allows you to receive updates on price changes for specific movies.**
